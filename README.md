question 1)
  1). Currently there is no implementation for sing method in bird class  which is an issue with the current code sinppit. I have implemented a         very basic void sing method which will just print out I'm Sining.
    a). Since this sing method is very basic,  we can not implement so many test cases. I have implement one basic test case which will directly call the sing method.
    b). for the maintainability, Since there are no concrete representation for animal and bird classes, we can make both animal and bird classes abstract and when there is an actual implemntation of bird or animal calss we can have implemntations specific to behaviors of those classes.
